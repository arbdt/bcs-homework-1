# Code Refactoring
This repository is for BCS assignment 1: Code Refactoring.
For this task, I was provided with a working web page. My role was to go through the HTML in Visual Studio and alter elements to be more semantic, and add alt text to the images where appropriate.

### Deployment
The deployed web page can be found [here](https://arbdt.github.io/bcs-homework-1).
